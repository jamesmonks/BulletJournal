# BulletJournal

This web app is a to-do list with a twist. All items written have only 2 days to live before they are lost forever.

Using the principles behind Bullet Journalling, I created this for when inspiration hits me on the go and I need to write a to-do, but I don't want to have it just sit there uselessly.
