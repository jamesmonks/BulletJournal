# BulletJournal

This web app is a to-do list with a twist. All items written have only 2 days to live before they are lost forever.

Using the principles behind Bullet Journalling, I created this for when inspiration hits me on the go and I need to write a to-do, but I don't want to have it just sit there uselessly.

Try it out via [github pages](https://jamesmonks.github.io/BulletJournal/)

# About this project
This project is a productivity tool I use. It helped me understand the basics of Bootstrap / Firebase, and is now being tweaked to improve it's functionality.
